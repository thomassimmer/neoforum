# neoforum

This is a simple project to learn Node.js and React.

You can see it running [here](https://neoforum.herokuapp.com/).

For now, only an authentication system is available. More features to come.

To start the project locally, you have to run this command at the root of this folder:

`npm run dev`

And inside the folder client/, run:

`npm start`
